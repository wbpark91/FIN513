\begin{homeworkProblem}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Agree. Generally, low-growth stock gives higher dividend than high-growth stock. Since high-growth company needs more capital than low-growth company, the amount of retained earning might be larger than that of low-growth company. Therefore, the futures price of high-growth stock will be a less discount over the spot price.
\item
Disagree. Regardless of possibility of bankrupt, a portfolio which replicates payoff of forward can be constructed. Therefore, we do not have to care about bankrupt when pricing a forward contract.
\item
Agree. When constructing replicating portfolio which replicates the dynamics of value of derivatives to value the derivatives relatively, we assume self-financing. that means all dividends are reinvested. If price of stocks does not drop by the amount of the dividend per share, the value of position of replicating portfolio would be greater than the value of stock, and it contradicts the meaning of replicating portfolio.

\begin{homeworkProblem}%%[Exercise \#\arabic{homeworkProblemCounter}] % Custom section title
Let $r_L^D$ denote dollar rates for lending, $r_L^E$ denote euro rates for lending, $r_B^D$ and $r_B^E$ denote dollar and euro rates for borrowing, respectively. Let $S_t^B$ and $S_t^O$ denote bid and offer exchange rate, respectively. In the following way, we can replicate long position and short position of dollar/euro forward.
%%
\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item \textit{Replicate Long Position}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Borrow $S_t^O \frac{1}{(1 + 0.5r_L^E)^{2(T-t)}}$ dollars at rate $r_B^D$
		\item Exchange $S_t^O \frac{1}{(1 + 0.5r_L^E)^{2(T-t)}}$ dollars to $\frac{1}{(1 + 0.5r_L^E)^{2(T-t)}}$ euros, then invest for time $T-t$ at rate $r_L^E$.
	\end{enumerate}
	At time $T$, the value of strategy (a) becomes $-S_t^O (\frac{1 + 0.5r_B^D}{1 + 0.5r_L^E})^{2(T-t)}$ dollars and the value of strategy (b) becomes 1 euro which perfectly replicates long position of forward contract. Since the initial values of two strategies are identical, the forward price $F_{t, T}$ should be equal to $S_t^O (\frac{1 + 0.5r_B^D}{1 + 0.5r_L^E})^{2(T-t)}$ dollars.
	
\item \textit{Replicate Short Position}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Borrow $\frac{1}{(1 + 0.5r_B^E)^{2(T-t)}}$ euros at rate $r_B^E$
		\item Exchange $\frac{1}{(1 + 0.5r_B^E)^{2(T-t)}}$ euros to $S_t^B \frac{1}{(1 + 0.5r_B^E)^{2(T-t)}}$ dollars, then invest at rate $r_L^D$.
	\end{enumerate}
	At time $T$, the value of strategy (a) becomes -1 euro, which is identical to short position of forward contract. Therefore, if there is no arbitrage in market, the forward price should be equal to the value of strategy (b) at time $T$, which is $S_t^B (\frac{1 + 0.5 r_L^D}{1 + 0.5r_B^E})^{2(T-t)}$
\end{enumerate}

Since $r_L^D < r_B^D$, $r_L^E < r_B^E$ and $S_t^B < S_t^O$, the value of replicate portfolio of short position is less than that of long position. Therefore, the upper and lower bound of the contract is $S_t^O (\frac{1 + 0.5r_B^D}{1 + 0.5r_L^E})^{2(T-t)}$ and $S_t^B (\frac{1 + 0.5 r_L^D}{1 + 0.5r_B^E})^{2(T-t)}$, respectively. Table \ref{tab:problem2} shows that the numerical results using parameters on the homework sheet.

%	PROBLEM 3
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{homeworkProblem}%%[Prob. \Roman{homeworkProblemCounter}] % Roman numerals
Assume that the fair price of single price is $x$, then $x$ should be larger than 308 and smaller than 313. Consider the following strategy.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Get a long position on the original contract.
	\item Get a short position on the new contract.
\end{enumerate}
Since the cash flow at time $t = 1.5$ is known at $t = t_0$, we can reinvest the net cash flow($x - 308$) at $t = 1.5$ to $t = 2$ by using the following strategy.

\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item sell short $x - 308$ amount of zero coupon bond with maturity $t = 1.5$
	\item buy $\frac{(x - 308)B_{0, 1.5}}{B_{0, 2}}$ amount of zero coupon bond with maturity $t = 2$.
\end{enumerate}
By netting out the values of strategy (1) and (2), there is no initial amount of cash flow. Furthermore, the strategies also makes cash flow at $t = 1.5$ to be zero. Finally, at time $t = 2$, the net cash flow from the whole strategies is equal to $x - 313 + (x - 308)\frac{B_{0, 1.5}}{B_{0, 2}}$. Since there is no cash flow before $t = 2$, the net cash flow at $t = 2$ should be equal to zero, otherwise there exists arbitrage opportunities. Therefore, the following equation holds.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
	&x - 313 + (x - 308)\frac{B_{0, 1.5}}{B_{0, 2}} = 0	\\
	&\Rightarrow B_{0, 1.5}x + B_{0, 2}x = 308B_{0, 1.5} + 313B_{0, 2}	\\
	&\Rightarrow (0.912 + 0.883)x = 308 \times 0.912 + 313 \times 0.883	\\
	&\Rightarrow x = 310.4596
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Therefore, the fair price that a market maker would be willing to offer is 310.4596.

%	PROBLEM 4
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{homeworkProblem}%%[Prob. \Roman{homeworkProblemCounter}] % Roman numerals
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item	%% Sub-Problem(a)
	If firm L did not lend out stocks, they will get 1,000,000 dollars for dividend and pay $1,000,000 \times 0.3 \times 0.3 = 90,000$ dollars for tax. Therefore, the net cash flow from dividend is equal to 991,000 dollars. It means firm L would require at least \$991,000 plus loan fee for payment.
	\item %% Sub-Problem(b)
	Consider the following agreement.
	\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
		\item Firm L lend out 1,000,000 shares which is consistent with (a).
		\item Firm H makes a repurchase agreement with firm E, which means firm H lend out 1,000,000 shares to firm E before dividend is paid, and get back after dividend is paid. This is possible since dividend schedule is certain.
	\end{enumerate}
	In this case, firm L does not have to pay tax because DRD is not applied. Unless the firm H pays premium larger than \$90,000, this contract is makes more profit for all firms. Firm E does not expose on any risk with respect to Google stock, firm L stays long and firm H stays short.
\end{enumerate}
\end{homeworkProblem}

%	PROBLEM 5
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{homeworkProblem}
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	%% Sub-Problem (a)
		\item Assume that the contract is closed at time $T$. The contract is equivalent to a contract in which person who is in long position would get a stock, and would pay $c$ and interest when the position is closed. Since we assumed that interest is debited or credited continuously, the total payment is equal to $ce^{r(T-t)}$. Like forward contract, we can replicate same payoff by taking long position to a stock, and borrowing the amount of money to buy a stock. At time $T$, the value of long position to a stock would be $S_T$ and the value of short position to bond would be $S_t^{r(T-t)}$. If there is no arbitrage in market, the value of short position to bond should be equal to the total payment in CFD. Therefore, the following equation should hold.
		\begin{equation*}
			ce^{r(T-t)} = S_t^{r(T-t)}
		\end{equation*}
		Therefore, the fair price of CFD is $c = S_t$. Otherwise, there would be arbitrage opportunities.
	
	%% Sub-Problem (b)
		\item Let $t_0$ and $t_2$ be closing times and $t_1$ be open time. Assume that $t_0 < t_1 < t_2$. An arbitrage opportunity exists by using the following strategy.
		\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
			\item Take a long position on CFD.
			\item Take a short position on a underlying stock.
			\item Invest $S_{t_0}$ at rate $r$ with maturity $t_2$.
			\item Close every position at time $t_2$.
		\end{enumerate}
		Since the interest is charged only for the position held overnight, the amount of interest at time $t_2$ would be $S_{t_0}e^{r(t_1  -t_0)}$, and that is important key to make an arbitrage opportunity. Table \ref{tab:problem5} describes the payoff from the strategy. Since we already assumed that $t_2 > t_1$, the net payoff $S_{t_0}(e^{r(t_2 - t_0) - r(t_1 - t_0)})$ is greater than zero. Therefore, by using the strategy above, we can make arbitrage profit.
